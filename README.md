# hydro-check

# What is this for?

It is used to get an image of the hydro bill and upload it to my Google Drive so I don't have to log in and check myself.

# Technology

- NodeJS 18.2.0
- Puppeteer 16.1.0

## What is Puppeteer?

From the the Puppeteer website: _Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer runs headless by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium._

# Todo

Now that we can login, get the screenshot, and upload to Google drive, the project needs to be uploaded onto a server and re-tested on headless mode.
